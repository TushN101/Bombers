## **Report on Bombers**


### **What Are Bombers?**

Bombers are tools designed to flood a target service with an excessive volume of requests, messages, or data, aiming to exhaust its resources. This overload can disrupt the serviceâ€™s normal operations, leading to potential crashes, unresponsiveness, or degradation of performance. Typically, bombers are used in malicious activities to disrupt online services, websites, or communication channels like email.


### **Different Types of Bombers**

1. **SMS Bombers**: Flood a phone number with a high volume of SMS messages, exploiting limits on the number of messages a number can receive within a given time frame.

2. **Email Bombers**: Send a large volume of emails to overwhelm an inbox, making email management difficult or impossible.

3. **Call Bombers**: Similar to SMS bombers but flood a phone number with numerous calls.

4. **API Bombers**: Target APIs by sending numerous requests, potentially leading to service degradation or downtime.

### **General Recommendations for Preventing Bombing Attacks**

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement limits to prevent excessive requests or messages from a single source.
2. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up systems to monitor and alert for unusual traffic patterns.
3. **CAPTCHA**: Use CAPTCHA mechanisms to block automated abuse.
4. **IP Blocking**: Block or throttle IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior.
5. **API Security**: Ensure APIs are secured with authentication and proper validation.
